A responsive and interactive music player built using React that lets users enjoy songs with ease. This project features a playlist, playback controls, and an attractive UI with album art and song details.

## üõ† Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop viewing.
- **Styled Components**: Clean and cohesive styling using inline styles and React icons.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **React**: Component-based library for building the user interface.
- **React Hooks**: Utilizes `useState`, `useContext`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` for state management and side effects.
- **React Icons**: Font Awesome and other icons for interactive controls.
- **Context API**: Manages global state across components with `SongProvider`.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahulGangurde9172/react-music-player.git
   
   cd react-music-player
   
 ## üé® Components Overview

- **App**: The root component that wraps the `MusicPlayer` inside the `SongProvider`. This ensures that the entire application has access to the global state managed by the `SongProvider`.
  
- **MusicPlayer**: This component is responsible for handling playback controls, such as play, pause, next, and previous. It also displays album art, song title, and artist details. Navigation between songs is managed here, and it uses the context to update and retrieve song data.

- **PlayList**: This component renders a list of all available songs in the playlist. It highlights the currently playing song and allows users to select a different song to play by clicking on it.

- **SongProvider**: This is a context provider that manages the global state for the music player. It keeps track of the song list, the current song, and provides functions to navigate between songs. The `SongProvider` makes these properties and methods accessible to components within its context, ensuring consistent state management throughout the app.
